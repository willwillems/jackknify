Installation
============

`jackknify` can be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install jackknify

Alternatively, install using GitHub

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Joshiwavm/jackknify

Or directly from the source

.. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/Joshiwavm/jackknify
        cd jackknify
        pip install -e .

Just note that, `jackknify` uses ``casatasks`` and ``casatools``. This might cause a problem, so be wairy.
